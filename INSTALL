Installing Felix
================

Requirements
------------
* OCaml
* Python >= 3.0

Compilation
-----------

1. First build it with

fbuild/fbuild-light -O --prefix=/usr/local --buildroot=build

2. Install with

sudo flx --test=build/release-optimized --install
sudo cp build/release-optimized/bin/flx /usr/local/bin

Installation goes to directory /usr/local/lib/felix/felix-$version.

Default --prefix==/usr/local.
Default --buildroot=build.
For more build options say build/fbuild-light --help.

Note Felix does not currently install the binay for the command line
processor "flx". Each version of Felix has a completely separate
install directory. You may choose not to copy "flx" but instead
put it on your PATH.
