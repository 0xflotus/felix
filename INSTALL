Installing Felix: POSIX (UNIX, OSX, LINUX, etc)
===============================================

Requirements
------------
* OCaml >= 3.11
* Python >= 3.1
* C++ compiler (clang, gcc, msvc++)

Build
-----

make build

Test
----

make test

Docs
----

make doc

Install
-------

make install

You will need to put a sudo password.

WINDOWS: MSVC++
================

Ask for help on the mailing list. 


You WILL need a few basic unix tools for Windows
like make, cp, etc.

The build system should
more or less work out of the box up to installation,
provided you have Ocaml built with MSVC++, Python built with MSVC++,
and you have MSVC++ environment set up.

You should set HOME environment variable to mirror the Unix 
system setup. You should install Felix in 

  c:\usr\local\lib

just like on Unix.

Windows: other
==============

It should be possible to build Felix for Cygwin,
MSYS or other Windows setup but it may take a bit
of fiddling to make this work!
