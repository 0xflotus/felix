Felix is an advanced high performance statically typed scripting language.

It is as easy to run a program as Python:

```
flx filename
```

"just works". But underneath it generates highly optimised machine
binaries which outperform all interpreters, bytecode compilers,
virtual machines, and most compiled languages including C.
Felix is an aggressive inliner which performs whole program
analysis.
