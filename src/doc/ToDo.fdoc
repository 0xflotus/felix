@h1 Dependency Checkers
@h2 Felix
For Felix, given a file and a path, we make a list of all the Felix
files that files depends on and their signatures, and emit that list somewhere.

We also need to reparse any file if either the *.par file is out of date
or non-existant, or, the syntax definition changed.

I propose that the Felix compiler flxg generates the list, since
it performs the required recursive include file analysis already.
Say, in filename.fdep. The command line tool then only needs
to compare the time stamps of the *.par and *.flx files to determine
if recompilation is required.

Tecnically there are three other triggers: the syntax definition has
changed, the felix compiler itself has changed, or, certain command
line switches or environment variables affecting compilation output
have changed: the search path is one of these, flags which change
the verbosity of comments in the generated C++ are another.

@h1 C 
For C, we need to know if we have to recompile C code.
This is necessary if the Felix generated C is changed,
which is so if the generator ran. It is also true is
any of the dependent external files have changed,
for example any Felix runtime support library such
as faio or demux.

In addition, if the path changed, or, if any command
line switches such as macro values have changed.

@h1 Linkage
This primarily applies to static linkage, but it can
also impact dynamic linkage on Unix systems because
the linkage of objects files together to make shared
libraries or programs requires binding to a symbolic
link to a shared library, and, in some satisfaction of
external references is checked.

In addition, link switches including library paths may
have changed. Unfortunately linkage dependencies are
hard to calculate. However we can use flx_pkgconfig
to attempt to find all the libraries required.

@h2 Felix run time libraries
This is a special case. If the C++ source code for
any of the Felix run time libraries such as faio
has changed, these libraries need to be rebuilt.

For some of these libraries, it can be done directly
by Felix, for example we can even do the primary
build of faio from Felix, provided the tool doing
the rebuilding isn't dependent on Faio. Even if it is,
we only need a bootstrap version of the tool.
