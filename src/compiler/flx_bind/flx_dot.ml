(*
  Order of sugars for operator dot.

  1. If the lhs and rhs are functions and the codomain of the lhs agrees with
      the domain of the rhs, this is a reverse composition, eg:

      1 . (str . trim) --> compose(trim, str) 1
 
  2. If the lhs is a struct, cstruct, or record AND the rhs is a simple name
      AND the name is a component, it's the component

  3. Try get method (now, for any type not just struct!)

  4. Try reverse application

  5. Deref once, try for field name. If found, result is POINTER to component.

  PROPERTIES
  ----------

  Commutativity of reverse composition and reverse application, eg:

  1 . str . trim == (1 . str) . trim == 1 . (str . trim)

  This property is VITAL for comprehension: the dot operator is syntactically
  associative. SPECIAL NOTE: COUNTEREXAMPLE: for any non-polymorphic function
  it is impossible to confuse composition and application. But for polymorphic
  functions it's possible! Therefore the order MATTERS.
