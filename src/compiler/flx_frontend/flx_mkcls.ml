(*
This module is responsible for generating functional wrappers for 
constructions which are used as function values requiring
a closure, but which are not functions. For example union constructors
are not functions, but Felix allows them to be used as fuctions
because they take arguments. They can be converted to functions
on demand by simply wrapping them inside a function. In effect
this is lambda lifting done late.

Certain other terms represent functions but are not in the right
form to make a closure, in particular the series composition 
operator is intended to represent a function but needs a wrapper
to effect this.

This module generates wrappers as required and replaces cases of
closures of non-function entities with closures over the generated
wrappers.
