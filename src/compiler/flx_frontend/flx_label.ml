(* Previously this test tried to stop jumps through functions.
  Unfortantely a jump which goes through a function *statically*
  is not the same thing as a jump through a function dynamically.
  For example if the function contains a procedure doing a jump to 
  the functions parent, it's fine if the procedure is returned by
  the function as a closure then executed. Although that procedure
  *is* executed in the scope of the function's dead stack frame, 
  the jump does not cross the function call control boundary: 
  the function has returned.

  The check was inadequate anyhow, because said closure can
  be passed out of the procedure containing the variable,
  and executed after the procedure has died .. which is an error,
  since eventually the procedure will try to return a second time.

  This is a bug in the type system really. It should prevent
  re-entering dead procedures by preventing closures containing
  jumps into the procedure from getting outside the scope of the
  procedure.

  Unfortunately the GC only tracks data pointers, not 
  control pointers (a goto is basically a control pointer).
