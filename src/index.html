  Felix is a new programming language in the ML family.
  </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>
  <strong>Easy to Deploy:</strong> Felix is designed as a <em>scripting language</em> so it is 
  as <em>easy to use</em> as Ruby, Python or PHP,
  and provides the same kind of <em>platform independence</em> and <em>rapid prototyping</em>. 
  </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>
  <strong>Easy to read and write:</strong> Felix code is syntactically clean and provides
  many shortcuts for common requirements. The strongest feature here is what is left out:
  there are no classes and so you can't get bogged down in object oriented method spaghetti.

  </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>

  <strong>High performance</strong> is delivered by advanced data structures,
  whole program analysis with heavy inlining, and other high level optimisations. Felix then
  generates C++ which is then optimised at the low level by your favourite ISO C++ compiler 
  to generate machine binaries instead of bytecode. The result is sometimes faster than hand written C
  and can you can always embed C directly in your Felix code if required.
  </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>
  <strong>Reuse C and C++ libraries:</strong> Felix provides a simple way to bind almost seamlessly to C and C++ code,
  so you can continue to use all your favourite libraries: compatibility is assured
  because Felix uses the C/C++ object model.
  </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>
  <strong>Program correctness</strong> is supported by a wide range of features including <em>garbage
  collection</em> for automatic storage management, strict high power <em>static typing</em> including
  <em>overloading</em>, <em>parametric polymorphism</em>, Haskell style <em>type classes</em>, 
  and <em>type constraints</em>.

  <p><strong>Contract programming:</strong>
  Felix provides the best contract programming system of any production language.
  It has the usual assertions, pre-conditions, and post-conditions for
  functions, but also provides reductions, axioms, lemmas and theorems.
  Abstract typing is supported by modules, and contol over visibility.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Type system:</strong>
  The type system is formally an enhanced version of the typed lambda calculus plus
  pattern matching.  A wide range
  of functional programming constructions including first class nested
  functions with closures are provided. Felix also provides a range of type constructors
  including tuples, records, and stucts, cases and variants.
  </p><p>
  <strong>Fibres</strong>Felix provides fibres, also known as cooperative
  multi-tasking. Fibres are threads which exchange control by transmission
  of data on channels. </p>
  <strong>Network programming</strong> is enhanced by a built-in asynchronous 
  network I/O system coupled with both <em>pre-emptive threads</em>
  and uses channels for synchronisation.
  </p><p>
  <strong>User defined syntax:</strong>
  Felix is designed to support <em>domain specific sublanguage</em> development.
  The standard grammar is dynamically loaded and inline grammar extensions are
  relatively easy to program. Felix uses an EBNF variant for the grammar with
  parser actions coded in Scheme. The underlying parser is Dypgen, an extensible
  GLR parser.
