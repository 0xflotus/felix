@h1 Exception Handling Using Try/Catch

Felix allows you to handle exceptions thrown from C++ code.

Generally exceptions of this kind are not thrown by Felix library code but 
there are some conditions such as array out of bounds that will throw.  Also
any C++ libraries that are used may throw exceptions.

The syntax is

@felix
try
  statements;
catch vname : type-expr =>
  statements;
catch ....
endtry
@

This will generate a C++ try { ... } catch { ... } block.
