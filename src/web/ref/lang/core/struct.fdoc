@h1 Struct

You can use struct to define a record with methods, similar
to object-oriented programming:

@felix
struct X {
  x: int;
  fun get () => self.x;
}

var x = X(42);
println$ x . x, x. x.get();
@

This syntax can save some typing when creating a type of
object.  Behind the scenes it creates ordinary record types
and functions.
