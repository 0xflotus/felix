@h1 val

Val is used to declare a variable whose value does not change.  

@h2 Possible Lazy Evaluation

The compiler may decide that a {val} is not used often and use
lazy evaluation for a {val}.  In this case the value of the {val}
is determined based on the state of the program at the time the
{val} is accessed, not at the time the {val} is read.
