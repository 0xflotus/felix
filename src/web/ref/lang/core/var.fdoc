@h2 {var} Variables

A {var} can have a different value at different times 
within a program or a routine.

For example:

@felix
var k = "start!";
println k; // start!
k = "finish";
println k; // finish!
@

Note that once the assignment to var is completed, the value
does not change until the next assignment operation; the 
initialiser is evaluated "eagerly".
