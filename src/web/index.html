<p>Felix is a highly performant, scalable, and safe 
<a href="/share/src/web/articles/scripting_felix.fdoc">scripting language</a>
suitable for rapid development of software systems. It runs on the three
main operating systems including: 
<a href="/share/src/web/download_tarball.html">Windows, Mac OS X, Linux</a>, 
and can potentially run on others</p>

<P>It gets its speed from its C++ code generator which also provides
compatibility and <a href="/share/src/web/tut/cbind_index.fdoc">easy
interopability with existing C and C++</a> code bases. The native C++ compiler
does the hard work of low level optimisation whilst Felix does high level
optimisations and type-checking. The resulting code is very fast, sometimes
<em>"faster than the speed of light (C)"</em>, but can be platform independent
and is simple to deploy: just distribute the source files and run them, like a
scripting language.</p>

<p>Felix's type system is based on a combination of OCaml and Haskell. Like
OCaml, it provides strong support for <a
href="/share/src/web/tut/tutorial.fdoc#Functional Programming
Technology_h">functional programming</a>, whilst also supporting <a
href="/share/src/web/tut/tutorial.fdoc#Imperative Programming
Technology_h">imperative programming</a>.  The type system is strict and
includes <a href="/share/src/web/tut/polymorphism_index.fdoc">first-order
polymorphism</a> at its core; not bolted-on as in Java (i.e. generics) and C++
(i.e. templates). Felix supports <a
href="/share/src/web/tut/polymorphism_01.fdoc#Overloading_h">open
overloading</a> like C++, but only allows exact matches. It also provides <a
href="/share/src/web/tut/polymorphism_03.fdoc#Type classes_h">Haskell style
type classes</a> as an alternative way to obtain genericity.</p>

<p>Felix supports user defined macros and syntactic improvements.
This extensibility allows a developer to easily write domain specific
sub-languages (DSLs) with ease. The parser is GLR and the user actions are
written in R5RS Scheme.</p>

<p>A rich set of shortcuts makes programming a breeze. <a href="/share/src/web/tut/regexp_01.fdoc">Built-in
regular expression support</a> and other features provide string handling on par
with Perl. Web programming is enabled by built-in <a href="/share/src/web/tut/async_index.fdoc">asynchronous
socket I/O</a> combined with <a href="#">cooperatively multi-tasked fibres</a>
that would support millions of HTTP clients if only the server could supply
enough sockets. Context switching is achieved by a pointer swap, and state is
maintained by a spaghetti stack.</p>

<h3>Goals.</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>high performance</li>
<li>rapid prototyping and a scripting language deployment model</li>
<li>safety and correctness</li>
<li>scalability</li>
<li>adaptability</li>
<li>platform independence</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>The ability to obtain high performance in a wide variety of domains is
fundamental. Light-speed behaviour was a primary goal of C++ and it is for
Felix too. In fact, we aim for hyper-light performance: faster than C.</p>

<p>Network performance matters too. This means we need platform independent
asynchronous I/O.  To support a large number of clients, we need lightweight
threads with fast context switching.</p>

<b>Rapid Prototyping and scripting harness</b> <p>C++ is typically very hard to
build. Make files, macros, compiler and OS feature tests, switches, paths and a
huge array of poorly integrated non-portable tools make development a nightmare
compared with the easy of deploying Python or Perl scripts. IDEs fix these
problems in a clean way, but only handle boilerplate workflows.  </p>

<h3>Correctness</h3>
<p>Unfortunately dynamic typing is not amenable to reasoning about program
correctness, and traditional imperative programming also presents obstacles.
</p>

<p>We need:
<ul>
<li>static typing for low level safety</li>
<li>contract programming model for high level safety</li>
<li>automatic memory management without compromising performance</li>
<li>overloading for convenience</li>
<li>parametric polymorphism for data types</li>
<li>functional programming for correctness</li>
<li>imperative programming for performance</li>
<li>platform independence for portability</li>
<li>platform dependence for performance and low level programming</li>
<li>shared-memory concurrency for real-time performance</li>
<li>message passing for distributed concurrent cloud computing</li>
<li>low level optimisations for tight calculations</li>
<li>high level optimisations for overall application speed</li>
<li>extensible grammar in user space for implementing Domain Specific Sub-Languages</li>
<li>easy use of existing C and C++ libraries and code bases</li>
<li>built-in support for web development</li>
<li>built-in support for high performance computing</li>
<li>built-in support for game development</li>
</ul>
which quite a demanding list!
