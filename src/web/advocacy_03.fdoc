@h1 High Performance
High performance is delivered by advanced data structures,
  whole program analysis with heavy inlining, and other high level optimisations. Felix then
  generates C++ which is then optimised at the low level by your favourite ISO C++ compiler 
  to generate machine binaries instead of bytecode. The result is sometimes faster than hand written C
  and can you can always embed C directly in your Felix code if required.
