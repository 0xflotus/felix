<h1>Downloading Prebuilt Felix</h1>
<p>On linux you will require gcc. On OSX you will require clang.
On Windows, MSVC++.

<p>Please download a tarball from the directory below.
Create an empty directory and change into it.
Unpack the tarball into that directory.
The unpacked tarball is a complete Felix system ready to use.

<p>On Unix systems only, you will require sudo privilege.
The install goes to prefix
<pre>
/usr/local
</pre>
in prescribed places and cannot be changed, it must exist, it must
have bin and lib subdirectories, the bin directory must be on your
PATH and the lib directory must be on your (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
be otherwise searched by your dynamic linker.
<pre>
make install
</pre>
Enter sudo password.

<h2>Available Tarballs</h2>
<a href="http://felix-lang.org/$/usr/local/lib/felix/tarballs">tarballs</a> 

<h1>Building from Source</h1>
<p>Felix is currently available from the git repository on GitHub.
To download on a Unix box, ensure the following are installed:
<pre>
git
python 3.1 or better
ocaml 3.12 or better
g++ 4.1 or better OR clang 3.0 
</pre>
Note you must have <code>python3</code> on your path 
for the Makefile to work.
<p>
Felix builds on Linux,BSD and OSX. It builds on Windows using MSVC++ as
well. For Windows specific build instructions see <a href="./win.fdoc">here</a>.
For BSD specific build instructions see the &quot;Installing Felix: POSIX (BSD)&quot; section of the INSTALL File located in the top level of the felix source distrobution

<h2>Initial download</h2>
Then issue these
commands: For registered developers, using SSH:
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:felix-lang/felix.git
</pre>
For everyone else:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/felix-lang/felix.git
</pre>
then
<pre>
cd felix
make build
make doc
make test
</pre></p>
<p>Now to install Felix:
<pre>
make install           # sudo password required
mk_daemon /usr/local/bin/webserver --port=1116
# point your browser at http://localhost:1116
</pre>
Felix should now be installed in <pre>/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-1.1.6rc4</pre>
the core binaries in <pre>/usr/local/bin</pre> and the webserver should
be running on port 1116 (clearly, change details depending on version!).
</p>
<p>
All versions of Felix are installed concurrently. If you're finished
using a version you should delete the installation directory.
The binaries in <pre>/usr/local/bin</pre> are copies of those
in the last install directory.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
Please see the Makefile for more complete options.
You can also build a debug version of Felix:
<pre>
make build-debug
</pre>
This builds in directory <pre>build/debug</pre>. The code is
built with debug symbols and unoptimised.

If you like you can also build for a different word size using
<pre>
make build32 test32
make build64 test64
</pre>
(pick whichever the standard build didn't select). This is mainly
for checking if your code is portable.

<h2>Updating Felix</h2>
To update felix do this:
<pre>
cd felix
git pull
git submodule update
make build
make test
make doc
</pre>
Now you can install as before.  If the build doesn't work properly,
you can clean up with
<pre>
rm -rf build
</pre>
This is even more drastic:
</pre>
git clean -dfx
</pre>
<h2>Using Felix</h2>
To use Felix you prepare a file and invoke the command line harness:
<pre>
echo 'println$ "Hello World";'' > hello.flx
flx hello 
</pre>
You can also find sample code in directory <code>test</code> and <code>tut</code>.
Perhaps more interesting, but required SDL installed, graphics demos in <code>demos</code>.
<h2>Contributing to Felix</h2>
Always discuss on mailing list first.
To contribute directly to the main repository you will require
permission. Then you can do
<pre>
git commit -a
git push
</pre>
to push out a patch. If you don't have permission, you should register
with GitHub and fork a clone there, then download your working copy
from that. Now you can push to your fork. When you're ready you can
use the Github web interface to send a merge request email.

<h2>Bug Reports</h2>
<p>You can use the Github bug tracking tool and/or send an email to
the Felix mailing list.</p>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
<pre>
mailto:felix-language@googlegroups.com # registration required
mailto:felix-language@lists.sourceforge.net # registration required
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Web site</h2>
The main page is currently at
<pre>
http://felix-lang.org
</pre>
If you follow the installation procedure this should be
echoed on your local machine.
