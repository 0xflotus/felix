<h1>Downloading Prebuilt Felix</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>On linux you will require gcc. On OSX you will require clang.
On Windows, MSVC++.

<h2>Tarball</h2>
<p>Please download a tarball from the directory below.
Tarballs for OSX and Linux are posted occasionally.
As we currently do not have a Windows developer there
is no Windows tarball.</p>

<a href="http://felix-lang.org/$/usr/local/lib/felix/tarballs">tarballs</a> 


<h2>Unpack</h2>
<p>Create an empty directory, say <code>/home/myaccount/myfelix</code> and 
<code>cd</code> into it.</p>

<p>Unpack the tarball into that directory.
The unpacked tarball is an <em>uninstalled</em> Felix. 
It is a complete Felix system ready to use.
<pre>
mkdir /home/myaccount/myfelix
cd /home/myaccount/myfelix
tar -zxvf /home/myaccount/felix_1.1.9dev_Linux_tarball.tar.gz
cd ..
</pre></p>

<h2>Use uninstalled Felix</h2>
<p>Felix can be used immediately.
<pre>
mkdir mytest
echo 'println$ "Hello World";' &gt; hello.flx
/home/myaccount/myfelix/build/release/host/bin/flx --test=/home/myaccount/myfelix/build/release hello.flx
</pre></p>

<p>You can simplify the command if you put the directory
containing the executable in your <code>PATH</code>:
<pre>
export PATH=/home/myaccount/myfelix/build/release/host/bin:$PATH
flx --test=/home/myaccount/build/release/myfelix hello.flx
</pre></p>

<h2>Cache directory</h2>
<p>Felix uses a cache to improve performance and store
certain personal preferences. The default cache is located in
the directory
<pre>
$HOME/.felix
</pre>
on OSX and Unix systems. On Windows the cache is located in
<pre>
$USERPROFILE\.felix
</pre>
if the environment variable <code>HOME</code> doesn't exist.
</p>

<h2>Testing Felix</h2>
Felix comes with some regression tests. The easiest way to run these is:
<pre>
cd /home/myaccount/myfelix
make test
</pre>
This will create an a subdirectory <code>test</code> of the current directory
and run some tests. To avoid spoiling the source directory you can do this instead:
<pre>
BUILDROOT=/home/myaccount/myfelix make -f /home/myaccount/myfelix/Makefile test
</pre>


<h2>Installing Felix on OSX or Unix</h2>
<p>To remove the need to specify the Felix directory 
with the <code>--test=</code> parameter, you can install
Felix. On Linux and OSX the install directory will be
<pre>
/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-1.1.9dev/
</pre>
(where the actual version number will appear)
and a symlink will be created:
<pre>
/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-latest
</pre>
</p>
<p>
To install you will need to be a member of <code>sudo</code> group
with permission to create the above directories. Type
<pre>
make install
</pre>
and enter your sudo password when prompted. Do NOT install as root
or invoke the install under sudo or you will not be able to access
the cache.
</p>
<p>
The <code>flx</code> executable will also be copied to
<pre>
/usr/local/bin
</pre>
which must be on your <code>$PATH</code>.

<h2>Installing Felix on Windows</h2>
Unlike most Windows programs, Felix installs in the same locations
on Windows as on OSX or Unix, on drive <code>C:</code>. Of course
the filenames use \ instead of / as a separator.

<h2>Generic Install Structure</h2>
<p>In general, Felix does not need to be installed.
We recommend installation simply because it reduces the need
to specify long pathnames to <code>flx</code> and other
executable tools, and removes the need for the <code>--test=dir</code>
parameter which locates the Felix install directory. </p>
<p>The general recommended install structure is:
<pre>
/usr/local/lib/felix-version # some installed version
/usr/local/lib/felix-latest  # symlink to production version
</pre>
for each version, so multiple versions can be installed.
That is further subdivided into shared an non-shareable parts:
<pre>
# read only universal source text
/usr/local/lib/felix-latest/share 

# platform dependent configuration and binaries
/usr/local/lib/felix-latest/host  
</pre>
In addition to the default target <code>host</code> any number
of other target directories can be built. In this way the whole
install can be shared on a server for multiple platforms,
providing a single source and a target for each architecture.
</p>

<h1>Building from Source on Unix</h1>
<p>The source build is available if you require the latest code
and meet more stringent requirements. It is the only way to get
a Windows build at this time, you will need to join the mailing list
and get help to get the build to work.</p>

<p>Developers of Felix must use a source build.  </p>

<p>Felix is currently available from the git repository on GitHub.
To download on a Unix box, ensure the following are installed:
<pre>
git
python 3.1 or better
ocaml 3.12 or better
g++ 4.1 or better OR clang 3.0 
</pre>
Note you must have <code>python3</code> on your path 
for the Makefile to work.
<p>
Felix builds on Linux,BSD and OSX. It builds on Windows using MSVC++ as
well. For Windows specific build instructions see <a href="./win.fdoc">here</a>.
For BSD specific build instructions see the &quot;Installing Felix: POSIX (BSD)&quot; 
section of the INSTALL File located in the top level of the felix source distrobution.

<h2>Initial download</h2>
Then issue these
commands: For registered developers, using SSH:
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:felix-lang/felix.git
</pre>
For everyone else:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/felix-lang/felix.git
</pre>
then
<pre>
cd felix
make build
</pre></p>
<p>Now to install Felix:
<pre>
make install           # sudo password required
</pre>
Felix should now be installed in <pre>/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-1.1.9dev</pre>
the core binaries in <pre>/usr/local/bin</pre> and the webserver should
be running on port 1116 (clearly, change details depending on version!).
</p>
<p>
All versions of Felix are installed concurrently. If you're finished
using a version you should delete the installation directory.
The binary <code>/usr/local/bin/flx</code> is a copy of the <code>host/bin/flx</code>
in the last install directory.
</p>
<h2>Updating Felix</h2>
To update felix do this:
<pre>
cd felix
git pull
make bootstrap
</pre>
Now you can install as before.  If the build doesn't work properly,
you can clean up with
<pre>
rm -rf build
</pre>
This is even more drastic:
</pre>
git clean -dfx
</pre>

<h1>Contributing to Felix</h1>
<p>Always discuss on mailing list first.
To contribute directly to the main repository you will require
permission. Then you can do
<pre>
git commit -a
git push
</pre>
to push out a patch. If you don't have permission, you should register
with GitHub and fork a clone there, then download your working copy
from that. Now you can push to your fork. When you're ready you can
use the Github web interface to send a merge request email.</p>

<h2>Bug Reports</h2>
<p>You can use the Github bug tracking tool and/or send an email to
the Felix mailing list.</p>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
<p><pre>
mailto:felix-language@googlegroups.com # registration required
mailto:felix-language@lists.sourceforge.net # registration required
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Web site</h2>
<p>The main page is currently at
<pre>
http://felix-lang.org
</pre>
If you follow the installation procedure this should be
echoed on your local machine.</p>
