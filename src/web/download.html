<h1>Downloading Felix</h1>
<p>Felix is currently only available from the git repository on GitHub.
We have ceased providing packages and tarballs.
To download on a Unix box, ensure the following are installed:
<pre>
git
python 3.1 or better
ocaml 3.12 or better
g++ 4.1 or better OR clang 3.0 
</pre>
Felix builds on Linux and OSX. It is supposed to build on Windows
using MSVC++ as well however we cannot support Windows at this time and the build
is likely to fail. 

<h2>Initial download</h2>
Then issue these
commands:
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:felix-lang/felix.git
cd felix
make build
make doc
make test
</pre></p>
<p>Now to install Felix:
<pre>
make install           # sudo password required
mk_daemon /usr/local/bin/webserver --port=1116
# point your browser at http://localhost:1116
</pre>
Felix should now be installed in <pre>/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-1.1.6rc4</pre>
the core binaries in <pre>/usr/local/bin</pre> and the webserver should
be running on port 1116 (clearly, change details depending on version!).
</p>
<p>
All versions of Felix are installed concurrently. If you're finished
using a version you should delete the installation directory.
The binaries in <pre>/usr/local/bin</pre> are copies of those
in the last install directory.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
Please see the Makefile for more complete options.
You can also build a debug version of Felix:
<pre>
make build-debug
</pre>
This builds in directory <pre>build/debug</pre>. The code is
built with debug symbols and unoptimised.

If you like you can also build for a different word size using
<pre>
make build32 test32
make build64 test64
</pre>
(pick whichever the standard build didn't select). This is mainly
for checking if your code is portable.

<h2>Updating Felix</h2>
To update felix do this:
<pre>
cd felix
git pull
git submodule update
make build
make test
make doc
</pre>
Now you can install as before.  If the build doesn't work properly,
you can clean up with
<pre>
rm -rf build
</pre>
This is even more drastic:
</pre>
git clean -dfx
</pre>
<h2>Using Felix</h2>
To use Felix you prepare a file and invoke the command line harness:
<pre>
echo 'println$ "Hello World";'' > hello.flx
flx hello 
</pre>
You can also find sample code in directory <code>test</code> and <code>tut</code>.
Perhaps more interesting, but required SDL installed, graphics demos in <code>demos</code>.
<h2>Contributing to Felix</h2>
Always discuss on mailing list first.
To contribute directly to the main repository you will require
permission. Then you can do
<pre>
git commit -a
git push
</pre>
to push out a patch. If you don't have permission, you should register
with GitHub and fork a clone there, then download your working copy
from that. Now you can push to your fork. When you're ready you can
use the Github web interface to send a merge request email.

<h2>Bug Reports</h2>
<p>You can use the Github bug tracking tool and/or send an email to
the Felix mailing list.</p>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
<pre>
mailto:felix-language@googlegroups.com # registration required
mailto:felix-language@lists.sourceforge.net # registration required
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Web site</h2>
The main page is currently at
<pre>
http://felix-lang.org
</pre>
If you follow the installation procedure this should be
echoed on your local machine.
