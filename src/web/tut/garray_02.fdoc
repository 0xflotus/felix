@h1 Arrays
Now we have some background in sums and products, we can
move on to arrays. Consider:
@felix
var a : int * int * int = 1,2,3;
@
Here {a} is a tuple with the components which
are all integers. Its very boring to write this
out so we will allow a more compact notation:
@felix
var a = int ^ 3 = 1,2,3;
@
The {^} operator is being used to mean exponentiation,
or raising to a power. It makes sense, and follows
mathematical tradition, where real spaces is denoted {R^3}
(only with the 3 printed as a superscript!).

But wait, you say! We know that
@felix
  3 = 1 + 1 + 1
@
by definition. So it seems we have not merely allowed
you to write {int^3} but it follows from the usual
index laws:

@felix
T^n * T^m = T^(n+m)
