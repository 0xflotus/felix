@h1 Debugging
Felix has a number of special features to help with debugging.
Of course you can debug the generated C++ code in the usual way.
Don't forget you can say:
@pre
flx --nofelix prog
@
to skip translation of Felix programs to C++, which allows you to edit
the C++ code, say, adding debugging prints.
