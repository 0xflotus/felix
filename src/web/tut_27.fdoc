@h2 Apply function
Normally, you can only expect:
@felix
f x
@
to work when f is a function. However if you write a function:
@felix
fun apply (x:string, y:string) => x + y;
@
then you can write:
@felix
h := "Hello";
sp := " ";
world := "World";
println$ h sp world;
@
Applying a string to another string is now defined by the {apply} function.
We have turned {string} into an <em>applicative type</em>.
