Structures
==========

Struct Definitions
------------------

Structs are nominally typed records.

Cstruct Definitions
-------------------

A cstruct definition is similar to a struct definition,
except no C++ code is emitted for the type definition.
Instead, a C struct or union of the same name must be
defined, typically in a C include file.
