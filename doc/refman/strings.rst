Strings 
=======

Felix provides a basic string type, :code:`string` based on
C++ :code:`::std::basic_string<char>`. The operations are
defined in the library. 

String literals can use several lexical forms. 

Single quoted strings are delimited by either single or double
quote marks, and may not span  lines.

Triple quoted strings are delimited by either three single
or three double quote marks, and may span multiple lines.
