Identifiers
===========

Felix has a rich lexicology for identifiers.

C like identifiers
------------------

C like identifiers start with a letter, and are optionally
followed by a sequence of letters, underscores, single quotes,
hyphens, or ASCII digits. 

The first character may also be an underscore
but that is reserved for the system. 

Felix requires UTF-8 encoding.

.. code-block:: felix

    julie-marx
    xИΫຜشஇᄗデՖ

Note again please, only ASCII digits are permitted.
