Felix is an advanced high performance statically typed scripting language.
The current annotated reference manual is felix-ref.pdf.

It is as easy to run a program as Python:

flx filename

"just works". But underneath it generates highly optimised machine
binaries which outperform all interpreters, bytecode compilers,
virtual machines, and most compiled languages including C.
Felix is an aggressive inliner which performs whole program
analysis.

Features:

* generates highly optimised ISO C++
* advanced resource manager organises compilation and linkage
* often runs faster than C
* glueless binding to C and C++ libraries
* lightweight threads with channels
* asynchronous network I/O
* thread safe garbage collection
* strictly statically typed
* overloading
* first order parametric polymorphism
* polymorphism with constraints
* multitype Haskell style type classes
* type classes with real semantic specification
* semantics can be checked by theorem provers
* strong functional subsystem
* pattern matching
* first class function, sum, and product types
* Tre based regexp processing built in
* bindings to Gnu GMP and Gnu GSL included
* user definabled and inline extensible grammar
* builds on all platforms
* runs on all platforms
* open source FFAU (free for any use) licence
